$RISMUN group                                 (optional)

   This group controls solvent effect computations using 
the Reference Interaction Site Model (RISM). If this group 
is found in the input file, a RISM-SCF-cSED calculation 
is performed. It requires solvent data, and the standard ones 
are stored in the solv_data directory; test input files are 
in the example directory. The data is contained in 
the $HVDATA group, which needs to be added to the input file 
for RISM-SCF-cSED calculations.   

   The interaction between solute and solvent molecules 
in a RISM-SCF-cSED calculation is computed with electrostatic 
and non-electrostatic terms. The non-electrostatic term is 
evaluated with Lennard-Jones potential. The parameters of 
solvent molecules are included in the solvent data ($HVDATA).
The parameters of the solute molecule are set in the $UDATA group. 
The electrostatic potential is computed using constrained spatial 
electron density distribution (cSED). The fitting option for 
the cSED can be modified in $FITINP and $ABSINP. 

   The free energy, nuclear gradients and hessian calculations 
are programmed for RHF, UHF, and MCSCF wavefunctions and 
DFT or MP2 level calculations using RHF. The analytic gradients 
are available for closed-shell TD-DFT excited states, as well. 
The single-point calculation also supports the coupled cluster method 
in closed-shell systems. NMR chemical shifts can also be computed.

   In order to improve the convergence of the RISM-SCF-cSED 
calculations, it is recommended that FDIFF in the $SCF group 
is set to FALSE. In many cases, it is useful to set DIIS 
to TRUE as well, but if it does not work, try SOSCF=.T. instead.
 
                         ---------

CLTYP   Closure type in RISM calculation. 
        = HNC Hyper-netted closure (default)
        = KH  Kovalenko-Hirata closure
        = PSE2
        = PSE3
 
XMN     Mixing ratio in RISM-SCF inner cycle
        (Default: 0.4)

THR     Threshold in RISM-SCF inner cycle
        (Default: 1.0D-12)

IEQ     Flag to control solvent relaxation
        = 0  Solvent distribution is in equilibrium with QM state (default) 
        = 1  Solvent distribution is fixed
        = 2  Solvent distribution is fixed  (TDDFT & reference is ES state)

        (If IEQ=1 or 2, additional inputs, $VMAT and $PCORR, are required.)

NPRINT  Print flag in punch file
        = XY (two-digit integer)
           Y = 1 Radial distribution functions are printed out
                 ($GOFR group).
             = 0 No print
           X = 1 $VMAT, $PCORR are printed out
             = 0 No print

        The first column of $GOFR is the distances between 
        a solute site and a solvent site. If the solute atoms 
        in the input are listed in the order U1, U2, ... , UM 
        and the solvent atoms in the order V1, V2, ... , VN,
        the RDFs of the following pairs are printed in the order
        U1-V1, U2-V1, ... , UM-V1, U1-V2, ... , UM-V2, ... , UM-VN
        after the second column.

IROOT   State to which solvation structure is computed. 
        In the excited state calculation, IROOT must be set.
         (No default is provided.) 
        = 0  Ground state
        = n  n-th excited state

$FITINP group                                   (optional)

   This group controls the fitting of cSED. 

IFITU   Constraint used in the fitting
        = 0  No constraint
        = 1  Constraint so that d coefficient is positive
        = 3  Constraint so that the density on each atomic site
             is positive (default)

NMUESP  Exponent of the polynomial used in the constraint.   

XMUMX   Factor MU of the constraint. 
        See Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 91, 1540 (2018)

$ABSINP group                                   (optional)

   This group specifies the weight in the constrained fitting 
process of the density fitting (see J. Chem. Phys. 155, 204102 (2021)).  

JABS    type of the weight, w(r) 
        = 3  r**2 weight        (type II)
        = 4  exp[-(a_I/r)**12]  (type III)

   The difference between the fitting weight was discussed in 
the paper, J. Chem. Phys. 155, 204102 (2021).

$UDATA group                                    (optional)

   This group defines the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters 
for the solute molecule. The epsilon and the sigma parameter 
of each atom are specified in the same order as the coordinates. 
The parameters between two dissimilar non-bonded atoms 
are computed based on Lorentz-Berthelot rules. 
It is usually taken from force fields like OPLS and GAFF. 
Note that hydrogen atoms bonded to oxygen or nitrogen atoms 
may not be assigned LJ parameters, but the values must still 
be set. The epsilon 0.056 kcal/mol, and the sigma 1.0 angstrom 
is routinely used.

SGU     = An array giving the sigma parameters (angstrom).
EPU     = An array giving the epsilon parameters (kcal/mol).
